                        <h1>Nutrition and Health Benefits of Olives <label>(Part 2)</label></h1>
                        <h2>Olives are Full of Healthy Fats and Lower Risk of Heart Disease</h2>
                        <p>The much-lauded Mediterranean diet promotes eating healthy fats, including olives, as well as
                            olive oil. Fat does have more calories than carbohydrates or protein. But when it comes to
                            heart health, the type of fat you eat is more important than the amount. These dark, meaty
                            olives are a great source of healthy fats, primarily monounsaturated fats (good fats) or
                            MUFAs. Plenty of research has been done on MUFAs and their effect on heart
                            health. According to a 2022 review in Foods, it leans toward MUFAs having a positive effect
                            on blood lipid profiles, which include total cholesterol, LDL ("bad") cholesterol, HDL
                            ("good") cholesterol and triglycerides. The predominant fatty acid in olives is a
                            monounsaturated fat called oleic acid, making up 73% of the total oil content, followed by
                            linoleic and alpha-linoleic acid. The remaining fat content 15% of the fat in olives is
                            saturated fat and 11% is polyunsaturated--omega-6 and omega-3 fatty acids. Mono-unsaturated
                            fat in the diet increases good cholesterol and decreases high blood pressure, lowering the
                            risk of heart disease, atherosclerosis, or stroke. It may regulate cholesterol levels and
                            protect the LDL-cholesterol from oxidation. When free radicals oxidize cholesterol, blood
                            vessels are damaged and fat builds up in arteries, possibly leading to a heart attack.</p>
                        <p>In addition, oleuropein in kalamata olives has been shown to lower the risk of coronary heart
                            disease. According to studies, it may protect against acute adriamycin cardiotoxicity
                            (damage to the heart muscle) and reduce the oxidation of LDL or bad cholesterol.</p>
                        <p>High potassium levels in Kalamata olives assist in balancing sodium levels, thereby helping
                            to regulate blood pressure and aiding in promoting heart health.</p>
                        <h2>Improved Bone and connective tissue Health/ Olives May Help Prevent Osteoporosis</h2>
                        <p>Osteoporosis is characterized by decreased bone mass and bone quality. It can increase the
                            risk of fractures.</p>
                        <p>The rates of osteoporosis are lower in Mediterranean countries than in other European
                            countries, which has caused scientists to speculate that olives might be protective. Animal
                            studies suggest the plant compounds in olives help prevent bone loss. Human studies on this
                            are lacking, but the animal studies and the data linking the Mediterranean diet to decreased
                            fracture rates are promising.</p>
                        <p>The anti-inflammatory abilities of the monounsaturated fats, vitamin E, and polyphenols in
                            black olives may also help dull the asperity of asthma, osteoarthritis, and rheumatoid
                            arthritis. Most of the suffering in having one of these three bone maladies is brought about
                            by high levels of free radicals.</p>
                        <p>Kalamata olives provide calcium, magnesium, and other minerals essential for maintaining
                            strong bones and preventing osteoporosis. Studies have shown that kalamata olive oil can
                            increase
                            calcium absorption, which can help prevent loss of bone density or osteoporosis.</p>
                        <h2>Olives are good for skin and hair health / Anti-Aging Effects</h2>
                        <p>Beyond their antioxidant properties, which combat free radicals that cause aging, eating
                            olives helps skin stay soft and healthy since they also contain vitamin E, vitamin A and
                            oleic acid. The vitamin E content in Kalamata olives helps nourish the skin, promote
                            elasticity, and protect against UV damage, thus guarding against skin cancer and premature
                            aging. It can help keep the skin hydrated and minimize signs of aging. Oleuropein in
                            kalamata olives also protects the skin from ultraviolet damage and fights free radical
                            damage.</p>
                        <p>The vitamin E content in olives can also nourish your scalp and increase blood flow to it by
                            aiding in the formation of new blood capillaries and it helps nourish hair follicles.
                            Vitamin A balances the skin's pH which is essential for healthy, supple, and younger-looking
                            skin.</p>
                        <h2>Olives are one of Nature's brain food</h2>
                        <p>Olives contain polyphenols, a natural chemical that reduces oxidative stress in the brain. A
                            2013 study in mice showed that supplementation with olive polyphenols elevates levels of the
                            proteins (known as neurotrophins) nerve growth factor (NGF) and brain-derived neurotrophic
                            factor (BDNF). Both of these play a pivotal role in the growth, development, and survival of
                            brain cells.</p>
                        <h2>Olives Promote Good Eye Health</h2>
                        <p>The vitamin A content in Kalamata olives supports good vision and helps prevent age-related
                            macular degeneration. One cup of black olives contains ten percent of the daily recommended
                            allowance of vitamin A which, when converted into the retinal form, is crucial for healthy
                            eyes. It enables the eye to better distinguish between light and dark, thereby improving
                            night vision. Furthermore, Vitamin A is believed effective against cataracts, macular
                            degeneration, glaucoma, and other age-related ocular diseases.</p>
                        <h2>Olives Have Anti-Cancer Properties</h2>
                        <p>Olives contain the compound oleocanthal, which researchers have shown can kill cancer cells
                            in
                            petri dish experiments. Other studies in humans have shown a link between consuming olive
                            oil and reducing the risk of cancers, including breast cancer.</p>
                        <p>Chronic oxidative stress and chronic inflammation can be key factors in the development of
                            cancer and if our cells get overwhelmed by these, our risk of cell cancer is increased. By
                            providing us with rich supplies of antioxidants and anti-inflammatory nutrients, olives can
                            help us avoid this dangerous combination of chronic oxidative stress and chronic
                            inflammation,
                            which can damage healthy cells and lead to cancer.</p>
                        <p>Olives and olive oil are commonly consumed in the Mediterranean region, where the incidence
                            of cancer and other chronic diseases is lower than in other European or American countries.
                            It is possible that eating olives may help reduce the risk of cancer. High content of
                            antioxidants and oleic acid in test-tube experiments have been shown to be able to disrupt
                            the life cycle of cancer cells in the breast, colon and stomach.</p>
                        <p>Black olives are a great source of vitamin E, which has the brilliant ability to neutralize
                            free radicals in body fat. Especially when working with the stable monounsaturated fats
                            found in olives, vitamin E can make cellular processes safer. When such processes such as
                            mitochondrial energy production are not well protected, the free radicals produced can cause
                            oxidation, damaging a cell's mitochondria, and preventing the cell from producing enough
                            energy to supply its needs. If the DNA of a cell is damaged, it may well mutate and become
                            cancerous. Studies have shown that a diet supplemented with olive oil leads to a lower risk
                            of colon cancer, almost as low a risk as a diet rich in fish oil.</p>
                        <h2>Anti-Anxiety and Anti-Depressant Effects</h2>
                        <p>The presence of certain compounds in Kalamata olives may help reduce anxiety symptoms and
                            promote a calm state of mind. They may also contribute to improved mood and mental
                            well-being.</p>
